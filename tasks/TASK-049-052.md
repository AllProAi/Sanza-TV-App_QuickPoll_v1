### TASK-052: Implement mood-based recommendations
- Create mood detection/selection system
- Implement mood-to-content mapping algorithm
- Build mood-based content categories
- Create visual theming based on mood
- Implement mood transition suggestions
- Build mood history tracking

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, OpenAI API, TypeScript, localStorage
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/services/ai/ContentTagger.js - AI tagging service
  - src/services/ai/PersonalizedGreeting.js - Greeting service
  - src/services/ai/DescriptionGenerator.js - Description generation
  - src/services/ai/MoodRecommender.js - Mood-based recommendation
  - src/components/features/MoodSelector.js - Mood selection UI
- **Components/Services**: 
  - ContentTagger - AI content tagging service
  - PersonalizedGreeting - Greeting system service
  - DescriptionGenerator - AI content description generator
  - MoodRecommender - Mood-based recommendation service
  - MoodSelector - Mood selection component

## Success Criteria
- Content is accurately tagged with relevant attributes using AI
- Personalized greeting enhances user engagement
- AI-generated descriptions are natural and informative
- Mood-based recommendations accurately match content to emotions
- All AI services enhance the user experience
- AI features work efficiently with acceptable response times
- Features degrade gracefully when AI services are unavailable
- AI services integrate seamlessly with the rest of the application

## Implementation Guidelines
- Optimize AI service calls for performance and cost
- Implement caching for AI-generated content
- Create fallback mechanisms for when AI services are unavailable
- Use prompt engineering best practices for OpenAI interactions
- Balance AI personalization with privacy considerations
- Document AI service integration thoroughly
- Create analytics to measure AI feature effectiveness
- Implement progressive enhancement approach to AI features
- Ensure all AI-generated content is appropriate and aligned with content

## Testing Approach

## Notes from Current Agent
I've successfully implemented the advanced AI services as required by TASK-049 to TASK-052. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

1. **ContentTagger Service (TASK-049)**:
   - Created an AI-powered content classification system that automatically generates tags for content items
   - Implemented content similarity analysis based on tags
   - Built fallback mechanisms for when AI is unavailable
   - Added caching and persistence for efficiency

2. **PersonalizedGreeting Service (TASK-050)**:
   - Implemented a time-aware greeting system with morning/afternoon/evening/night detection
   - Created personalized welcome messages based on user preferences and viewing history
   - Added rotation system to avoid repetitive greetings
   - Integrated with content suggestions based on user behavior

3. **DescriptionGenerator Service (TASK-051)**:
   - Built an AI-powered system for generating enhanced content descriptions
   - Implemented different tone and length options for descriptions
   - Added personalization based on user preferences
   - Created template-based fallbacks for when AI is unavailable

4. **MoodRecommender Service (TASK-052)**:
   - Created a mood-based recommendation system with predefined mood categories
   - Implemented mood detection and content mapping algorithm
   - Built mood history tracking for personalized recommendations
   - Added mood transition suggestions for a smoother viewing experience
   - Created a MoodSelector UI component for the user interface

All services follow these design principles:
- Singleton pattern for consistent state management
- Extensive caching to minimize API calls and improve performance
- Graceful fallbacks when AI services are unavailable
- Persistent storage using localStorage to maintain user preferences across sessions
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety and developer experience

The implemented AI services significantly enhance the personalization of the StreamVibe application, providing users with a more tailored and engaging viewing experience.
