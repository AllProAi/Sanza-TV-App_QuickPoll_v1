# API Integration Implementation

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-045 to TASK-048  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Completion Time**: 2 hours  
**Previous Agent**: TASK-041-044 Agent

## Task Description
Implement the API integration for the StreamVibe TV App, including content API service setup, API caching, error handling, and response transformers. These services will provide the data layer for the application and ensure reliable content delivery.

## Context
This is part of the StreamVibe TV App being developed for the Senza platform hackathon. The application aims to create an AI-powered interactive TV experience optimized for remote control navigation at 1920x1080 resolution.

## Current Status
The core application infrastructure, UI components, content discovery, AI recommendations, video playback, and interactive features have been implemented. Now we need to build the API integration layer that will provide content data for the application.

## Requirements

### TASK-045: Set up content API service (mock for hackathon)
- Create mock content API service
- Implement content data structure
- Build sample content dataset
- Create API endpoint simulation
- Implement request/response patterns
- Build content categorization

### TASK-046: Implement API caching for performance
- Create in-memory cache for API responses
- Implement cache invalidation strategies
- Build cache persistence for offline use
- Create cache size management
- Implement prioritized caching for frequently accessed content
- Build cache analytics for optimization

### TASK-047: Create error handling for API failures
- Implement comprehensive error handling system
- Create user-friendly error messages
- Build fallback content for API failures
- Implement retry mechanisms
- Create graceful degradation strategies
- Build error logging and reporting

### TASK-048: Build API response transformers
- Create data normalization utilities
- Implement response mapping to content models
- Build content filtering and sorting utilities
- Create content metadata enrichment
- Implement content relation mapping
- Build data serialization/deserialization utilities

## Technical Details

- **Components/Services**: 
  - ContentAPI - Content data service
  - APICacheService - Caching service
  - APIErrorHandler - Error handling service
  - ResponseTransformer - Data transformation utilities

## Success Criteria
- Content API provides realistic data for the application
- API caching significantly improves performance
- Error handling gracefully manages API failures
- Response transformers correctly format data for the UI
- API service works reliably even with network issues
- Mock data is comprehensive enough for demo purposes
- Application can function in offline mode with cached data
- Performance is optimized through efficient data handling

## Implementation Guidelines
- Create realistic mock data that demonstrates all app features
- Implement efficient caching strategies to optimize performance
- Develop comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messaging
- Create clean data transformation layer between API and UI
- Document API service thoroughly for future real API integration
- Implement performance optimizations for data handling
- Create service interfaces that could work with real APIs later
- Use TypeScript interfaces for data type safety
- Implement proper loading states during API operations

## Testing Approach
- Test API service with various request scenarios
- Verify cache behavior and performance impact
- Test error handling with simulated failures
- Check offline functionality with cached data
- Verify data transformation accuracy
- Test with varying data volumes and types
- Measure performance metrics for API operations
- Verify consistency of mock data

## Notes from Current Agent
I've successfully implemented the API integration for the StreamVibe TV App with the following key components:

1. **ContentAPI Service**: Created a mock API service that simulates network requests, handles caching, and provides realistic content data. The service includes methods for fetching all content, individual items, categories, and more.

2. **APICacheService**: Implemented a comprehensive caching system with the following features:
   - In-memory cache with automatic expiration
   - Persistence to localStorage for offline use
   - Cache size management with LRU (least recently used) eviction policy
   - Cache statistics and analytics
   - Prefix-based cache invalidation

3. **APIErrorHandler**: Built a robust error handling system with:
   - User-friendly error messages based on error types and HTTP status codes
   - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter
   - Error history tracking for debugging
   - Fallback content for offline scenarios
   - Comprehensive logging with configurable log levels

4. **ResponseTransformer**: Developed a data transformation utility that:
   - Normalizes data from various sources into consistent content models
   - Handles missing or malformed data with sensible defaults
   - Provides sorting, filtering, and grouping capabilities
   - Enriches content with additional metadata when needed
   - Safely extracts and transforms properties with fallbacks

5. **Mock Data**: Created a comprehensive mock dataset with:
   - Movies, series (with seasons and episodes), documentaries, and live content
   - Realistic metadata including images, descriptions, and categories
   - Varied content types to demonstrate all app features

All components are designed to work together seamlessly while remaining independently testable. The system gracefully handles network failures, provides offline support, and ensures consistent data across the application. The implementation follows TypeScript best practices with strong typing and clear interfaces.

For real API integration in the future, only the ContentAPI service would need to be modified to connect to actual endpoints while maintaining the same interface, allowing the rest of the application to work without changes.
