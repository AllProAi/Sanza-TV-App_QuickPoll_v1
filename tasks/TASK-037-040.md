# Senza Remote Player Integration

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-037 to TASK-040  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Completion Time**: 3 hours  
**Previous Agent**: TASK-033-036 Agent

## Task Description
Implement the Senza remotePlayer integration for the StreamVibe TV App, including remote controls navigation, playback lifecycle management, watch progress tracking, and the "Continue Watching" feature. These features will enable seamless video playback with the Senza TV platform's native video capabilities.

## Context
This is part of the StreamVibe TV App being developed for the Senza platform hackathon. The application aims to create an AI-powered interactive TV experience optimized for remote control navigation at 1920x1080 resolution.

## Current Status
The core application infrastructure, UI components, content discovery screens, and AI-powered recommendation systems have been implemented. Now we need to integrate with the Senza platform's native video player and add robust playback management features.

## Requirements

### TASK-037: Implement Senza remotePlayer integration
- Create remote player wrapper in the PlaybackService
- Handle player events and state management
- Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Support adaptive streaming formats (HLS, DASH)
- Enable fullscreen mode for TV viewing
- Integrate with Senza SDK for remote control events

### TASK-038: Enhance playback controls UI with remote navigation
- Implement remote-friendly player controls
- Create focus navigation for control elements
- Build timeline scrubbing with remote control
- Support playback control with direction keys
- Implement quality selection controls
- Design TV-optimized player UI

### TASK-039: Implement playback lifecycle management
- Create playback session tracking
- Build watch progress persistence
- Implement auto-save of playback position
- Support resuming from previous position
- Add playback session analytics
- Create playback error recovery

### TASK-040: Build Continue Watching feature
- Implement Continue Watching data storage
- Create Continue Watching UI section
- Add progress indicators for partially watched content
- Build session-based watch progress tracking
- Implement "Resume Watching" functionality
- Auto-continue from previous position

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, Senza SDK, localStorage
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/services/PlaybackService.ts - Remote player integration
  - src/components/player/PlayerControls.tsx - Player UI controls
  - src/hooks/usePlayback.ts - Playback hook
  - src/components/content/ContinueWatchingSection.tsx - Continue watching UI
  - src/components/content/ContinueWatchingCard.tsx - Continue watching card
  - src/pages/PlayerPage.tsx - Main player page
- **Components/Services**: 
  - PlaybackService - Core playback management
  - PlayerControls - Remote-friendly controls
  - ContinueWatchingSection - Home page section
  - ContinueWatchingCard - Specialized card with progress

## Success Criteria
- Remote player integration works with the Senza SDK
- Player controls are easily navigable with a remote control
- Playback position is properly saved and restored
- Continue Watching section shows in-progress content
- Progress indicators accurately reflect watch status
- User can easily resume content from the home screen
- Playback continues from the previous position
- Analytics data is collected for playback sessions

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use the singleton pattern for the PlaybackService
- Ensure UI is optimized for remote control (no hover states)
- Cache watch progress in localStorage for offline scenarios
- Follow existing UI component patterns for consistency
- Create robust error recovery for network/player issues
- Follow the existing FocusableItem pattern for remote navigation
- Implement proper cleanup for memory management
- Document the player integration thoroughly

## Testing Approach
- Test player controls with keyboard navigation
- Verify watch progress is saved correctly
- Check session tracking accuracy
- Test across different content types (movies, episodes)
- Verify Continue Watching shows correct content
- Test error recovery scenarios
- Validate remote control navigation flow

## Notes from Current Agent
I've successfully implemented the Senza remotePlayer integration and Continue Watching feature for the StreamVibe TV app as required in tasks 037-040. Here's a summary of what's been accomplished:

### TASK-037: Senza remotePlayer Integration
- Enhanced the PlaybackService to integrate with the Senza remote player through the SDK
- Implemented comprehensive event handling for player state changes
- Added error recovery mechanisms and fallbacks
- Created robust state management for the video player
- Added support for different streaming formats and quality levels

### TASK-038: Enhanced Playback Controls
- Created a PlayerControls component optimized for remote navigation
- Implemented focused states and navigation patterns for TV remotes
- Built timeline scrubbing with keyboard/remote control support
- Added quality selection and fullscreen controls
- Created a video player page with proper remote navigation

### TASK-039: Playback Lifecycle Management
- Implemented playback session tracking and analytics
- Created watch progress persistence with localStorage
- Added automatic progress saving at regular intervals
- Implemented session-based analytics for content consumption
- Built error handling with automatic recovery mechanisms

### TASK-040: Continue Watching Feature
- Created a dedicated ContinueWatchingSection for the home page
- Implemented ContinueWatchingCard with progress indicators
- Added auto-resume functionality for in-progress content
- Built data persistence for watch progress across sessions
- Implemented sorting by recently watched content

The player integration now provides a seamless TV viewing experience with all the expected features of a modern streaming platform. The Continue Watching section gives users an easy way to return to content they were previously watching, enhancing the overall user experience.

All components have been designed with TV navigation in mind, ensuring easy access with remote controls. The implementation follows the design patterns established in the rest of the application, maintaining consistency throughout the user interface.

The video playback system is now ready for integration with additional features such as casting to external devices, which will be implemented in the next task.
