# AI Agent Task Template

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-011  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Completion Time**: 1 hour  
**Previous Agent**: TASK-006-010 Agent

## Task Description
Set up a comprehensive state management system for the StreamVibe TV App using React Context API. This will provide a global state container that makes data accessible throughout the application while maintaining good performance and separation of concerns.

## Context
This is part of the StreamVibe TV App being developed for the Senza platform hackathon. The application aims to create an AI-powered interactive TV experience optimized for remote control navigation at 1920x1080 resolution.

## Current Status
The core application infrastructure and remote control navigation system have been implemented in previous tasks. Now we need to establish a global state management system to handle application-wide data such as user preferences, content data, and playback state.

## Requirements
- Create a primary AppContext for global application state
- Set up separate, specialized contexts for different concerns (Content, User, Player, etc.)
- Implement context providers with appropriate state initialization
- Create custom hooks for accessing context data and actions
- Ensure good performance with context splitting and memoization
- Implement persistence for relevant state data
- Document the context structure and usage patterns

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, React Context API, React Hooks
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/contexts/AppContext.js - Main application context
  - src/contexts/ContentContext.js - Content management context
  - src/contexts/UserContext.js - User preferences context
  - src/contexts/PlayerContext.js - Video player state context
  - src/hooks/useAppContext.js - Hook for accessing app context
- **Components/Services**: 
  - AppContextProvider - Global application state provider
  - ContentProvider - Content state provider
  - UserProvider - User preferences provider
  - PlayerProvider - Video player state provider

## Success Criteria
- Global state is accessible throughout the application
- Context is structured to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- State persists appropriately between sessions
- Context provides both state and action methods
- State management is documented and easy to use
- Performance is maintained even with complex state

## Implementation Guidelines
- Split contexts by domain/concern to optimize performance
- Use useReducer for complex state management
- Implement memoization where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Create custom hooks for each context to simplify access
- Follow React best practices for context providers
- Keep business logic within context providers, not components
- Implement persistence using localStorage where appropriate

## Testing Approach
- Verify that context state updates properly
- Test that components only re-render when necessary
- Check that state persists correctly between sessions
- Verify that context providers initialize with correct default values
- Test performance with React DevTools

## Notes from Current Agent
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive state management system for the StreamVibe TV App using React Context API. Here's what I've accomplished:

1. **Context Structure**: Created four separate context providers to manage different concerns:
   - AppContext: For global application settings (dark mode, online status, debug mode)
   - ContentContext: For managing content items, categories, favorites, and watch progress
   - UserContext: For user authentication, profiles, and preferences
   - PlayerContext: For video player controls, state, and progress tracking

2. **Performance Optimization**: 
   - Implemented useReducer pattern for complex state management
   - Added memoization for action creators and derived values
   - Split contexts by domain to avoid unnecessary re-renders
   - Used selective state updates to minimize render cycles

3. **Persistence**:
   - Implemented localStorage persistence for relevant state:
     - App settings in AppContext
     - User profiles and preferences in UserContext
     - Favorites and recently watched items in ContentContext
     - Video progress in PlayerContext
   - Added state restoration on component mount

4. **Custom Hooks**:
   - Created dedicated hooks for each context to simplify access:
     - useAppContext
     - useContentContext
     - useUserContext
     - usePlayerContext
   - Added error handling for improper usage outside providers

5. **Integration**:
   - Nested context providers in the correct order in App.tsx
   - Ensured proper provider hierarchy based on dependencies
   - Set up the NavigationProvider within the existing AppLayout

The system is now ready for use throughout the application. Components can easily access and update global state using the custom hooks without prop drilling. The context structure is organized by concern, making it clear where each type of state should be managed.
