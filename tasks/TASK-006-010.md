# Remote Control Navigation System

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-006 to TASK-010  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Completion Time**: 3 hours  
**Previous Agent**: TASK-002-005 Agent

## Task Description
Design and implement a comprehensive remote control navigation system for the StreamVibe TV App. This is a critical component as it defines how users will interact with the application using only a TV remote control. The system needs to handle focus management, directional navigation, visual feedback, keyboard shortcuts, and maintain navigation state.

## Context
This is part of the StreamVibe TV App being developed for the Senza platform hackathon. The application aims to create an AI-powered interactive TV experience optimized for remote control navigation at 1920x1080 resolution.

## Current Status
The core application infrastructure, including the development environment, Senza SDK integration, and base routing have been set up in TASK-002-005. Now we need to build the remote control navigation system that will allow users to navigate the app using directional keys.

## Requirements

### TASK-006: Implement focus management system
- Create a system to track the currently focused element
- Implement focus persistence across component renders
- Build helper hooks for focus management
- Handle focus restoration when returning to screens
- Implement focus trapping for modal components

### TASK-007: Create directional navigation utilities
- Build utilities for handling arrow key navigation (up, down, left, right)
- Implement spatial navigation algorithm for finding the nearest navigable element
- Create navigation groups for complex layouts
- Build helper functions for common navigation patterns
- Support for circular navigation (wrapping around edges)

### TASK-008: Build focus visual feedback components
- Create consistent visual indicators for focused elements
- Implement smooth transitions between focus states
- Build reusable focus indicator components
- Create animation system for focus transitions
- Ensure focus indicators work across different component types

### TASK-009: Implement keyboard shortcut system
- Create a central keyboard shortcut manager
- Support for key combinations and sequences
- Implement context-aware shortcuts
- Build debugging tools for keyboard navigation
- Create documentation for keyboard shortcuts

### TASK-010: Create navigation context provider
- Implement a React Context for global navigation state
- Create provider component with navigation methods
- Build consumer hooks for components to access navigation functionality
- Implement navigation history and back functionality
- Support for nested navigation contexts

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, React Hooks, React Context API
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/contexts/NavigationContext.js - Navigation context provider
  - src/hooks/useFocus.js - Focus management hook
  - src/hooks/useKeyboardNavigation.js - Keyboard navigation hook
  - src/components/FocusableItem.js - Base focusable component
  - src/components/FocusIndicator.js - Visual focus indicator component
- **Components/Services**: 
  - NavigationProvider - Context provider for navigation state
  - FocusableItem - Base component for focusable elements
  - FocusManager - Service for handling focus state
  - KeyboardManager - Service for handling keyboard input

## Success Criteria
- Navigation system works smoothly with arrow keys
- Focus is visually clear and transitions smoothly between elements
- Navigation behaves predictably and intelligently
- Keyboard shortcuts work consistently across the application
- Navigation state persists correctly when moving between screens
- Components can easily integrate with the navigation system

## Implementation Guidelines
- Create a foundation of reusable hooks and components
- Ensure the system is flexible enough to support different layout patterns
- Prioritize performance to ensure smooth transitions
- Make sure navigation behavior is intuitive and predictable
- Document the navigation system thoroughly for other developers
- Follow React best practices for context and state management

## Testing Approach
- Test navigation with keyboard inputs (arrow keys, enter, escape)
- Verify focus behavior across different screen layouts
- Test keyboard shortcuts in different application contexts
- Verify focus restoration when returning to previous screens
- Test focus trapping in modal components
- Verify accessibility of the navigation system

## Notes from Current Agent
I've successfully implemented the comprehensive remote control navigation system for the StreamVibe TV app. Here's a summary of the key components:

1. **Navigation Context Provider**:
   - Created a robust NavigationContext with support for focus tracking, history, groups, and spatial navigation
   - Implemented focus trapping for modals
   - Added focus history management with automatic restoration when returning to previous screens

2. **Focus Management**:
   - Built a powerful useFocus hook that manages all focus-related functionality
   - Implemented focus persistence across component renders
   - Created a system for focus groups and nested navigation contexts
   - Added spatial navigation algorithms to find the nearest focusable element

3. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Developed FocusableItem component as the foundation for all focusable elements
   - Created attractive FocusIndicator with smooth animations and transitions
   - Added customizable indicator styles for different component types

4. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Implemented a comprehensive keyboard shortcut system via KeyboardManager
   - Created useKeyboardNavigation hook for component-level keyboard handling
   - Added support for key combinations and context-aware shortcuts
   - Built in debugging capabilities for keyboard navigation testing

5. **Navigation Utilities**:
   - Implemented NavigationGroup component for handling complex layouts
   - Created utilities for common navigation patterns (grids, lists, etc.)
   - Added support for circular navigation and edge handling
   - Built a NavigationDebugger component for development assistance

The navigation system is now ready for use across the application. Developers can easily create focusable components using the useFocus hook or the FocusableItem component. For more complex layouts, the NavigationGroup component provides automatic management of directional relationships.

For debugging, developers can use the NavigationDebugger component which shows focus state, history, and keyboard events in real-time.
