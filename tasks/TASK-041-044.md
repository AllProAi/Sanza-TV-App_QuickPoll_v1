# Quick Poll and Interactive Video Integration

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-041 to TASK-044  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Completion Time**: 4 hours  
**Previous Agent**: TASK-037-040 Agent

## Task Description
Implement interactive video features for the StreamVibe TV App, including in-video polls, quizzes, information cards, and viewer reactions. This enhances the viewing experience by adding real-time engagement opportunities during video playback.

## Context
This continues the development of the StreamVibe TV App for the Senza platform hackathon, building on the recently completed video player integration. These interactive features will enable content creators to engage viewers during playback through structured interactions.

## Current Status
The core video player functionality has been implemented with the Senza remote player integration. The application now needs interactive overlays and engagement mechanisms to enhance the viewing experience.

## Requirements

### TASK-041: Implement Interactive Service Architecture
- Create a service for managing interactive video elements
- Develop a time-based system for displaying elements at specific points in videos
- Build event system for interactive element lifecycle
- Implement persistence for user interactions
- Create interface for registering interactive elements

### TASK-042: Build In-Video Poll System
- Create overlay UI for displaying polls during video playback
- Implement remote-friendly poll option selection
- Build results visualization with animated progress bars
- Create poll creation and management interfaces
- Implement persistence for poll responses

### TASK-043: Develop Quiz and Information Card Functionality
- Build quiz component with correct/incorrect feedback
- Implement scoring system for quizzes
- Create collapsible information cards for contextual details
- Support media display in information cards
- Enable external linking from information cards

### TASK-044: Add Viewer Reactions and Improvements
- Create emoji reaction system for viewers
- Build reaction summary visualization
- Implement reaction picker UI
- Optimize performance for multiple concurrent interactive elements
- Ensure accessibility for all interactive components

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, styled-components
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/services/InteractiveService.ts - Core interactive element management
  - src/components/interactive/* - UI components for interactive elements
  - src/hooks/useInteractiveVideo.ts - Hook for interactive feature integration
  - src/pages/PlayerPage.tsx - Integration with player experience
- **Components/Services**: 
  - InteractiveService - Core management of interactive elements
  - PollOverlay - In-video poll display
  - QuizOverlay - Quiz question display
  - InfoCard - Information card component
  - ReactionSelector - Emoji reaction picker

## Success Criteria
- Interactive elements appear at the correct time during video playback
- Users can interact with polls, quizzes, and reactions via remote control
- Results are displayed immediately after interaction
- Information cards provide additional context without disrupting playback
- All interactive elements are optimized for TV viewing at 1920x1080 resolution
- Interactive elements persist across viewing sessions
- Performance remains smooth with multiple interactive elements

## Implementation Guidelines
- Focus on TV-friendly navigation patterns using directional controls
- Ensure all interactive elements are visually consistent with the app's design
- Use transitions and animations for a polished user experience
- Add sound effects for interactions to enhance engagement
- Implement proper focus management for remote control navigation
- Ensure all elements can be dismissed with the ESC key

## Testing Approach
- Test with keyboard navigation to simulate remote control
- Verify timing accuracy of interactive element appearance
- Test with different video lengths and position combinations
- Verify persistence of user responses
- Test focus management across all interactive elements
- Validate accessibility features

## Notes from Current Agent
I've successfully implemented the interactive video features for the StreamVibe TV App, including in-video polls, quizzes, information cards, and viewer reactions.

The core of this implementation is the InteractiveService, which manages the timing and lifecycle of interactive elements. It tracks the current playback position and displays interactive elements at specified timestamps.

Key components developed:

1. **PollOverlay**: Allows viewers to vote on questions during playback, with real-time results visualization.

2. **QuizOverlay**: Presents trivia questions with correct/incorrect feedback and point scoring.

3. **InfoCard**: Provides contextual information about scenes, actors, or background details in a collapsible format.

4. **ReactionSelector**: Enables viewers to react with emoji during playback to express emotions.

All components are designed for remote control navigation with proper focus management and keyboard accessibility. They integrate seamlessly with the existing player controls and can be easily dismissed when no longer needed.

The implementation includes a useInteractiveVideo hook that makes it easy to integrate these features into any video playback component. The hook handles event listeners, state management, and user interactions.

Performance was a key consideration, with all interactive elements using efficient state updates and animations. The implementation is also designed to scale, allowing for future additions of new interactive element types.

The next logical step would be to use the data collected from these interactive elements to enhance the recommendation system, which is suggested for TASK-045.
