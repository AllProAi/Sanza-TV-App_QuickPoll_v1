**Estimated Completion Time**: 30 minutes  
**Previous Agent**: N/A

## Task Description
Initialize a new React project with appropriate configurations for the StreamVibe TV App. Set up the essential project structure and dependencies needed for developing a Senza platform compatible application.

## Context
This is part of the StreamVibe TV App being developed for the Senza platform hackathon. The application aims to create an AI-powered interactive TV experience optimized for remote control navigation at 1920x1080 resolution.

## Current Status
New project initialization, no existing code base.

## Requirements
- Create a project structure that follows modern React best practices
- Include all necessary dependencies for the Senza platform
- Configure the build system for optimal compatibility
- Set up a development environment that supports quick iteration
- Configure for 1920x1080 resolution (HD TV)

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, Webpack, Senza SDK, CSS Modules
- **Related Files**: 
  - package.json - Project configuration and dependencies
  - webpack.config.js - Build configuration
  - .gitignore - Version control exclusions
  - public/index.html - HTML entry point
- **Components/Services**: 
  - Initial App component structure

## Success Criteria
- Project successfully initializes without errors
- Development server runs correctly
- Senza SDK is properly installed and configured
- Basic "Hello World" renders at 1920x1080 resolution
- Project structure supports the planned component architecture

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use Create React App or a custom webpack setup based on project needs
