# Layout Components Development

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-015 to TASK-019  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Completion Time**: 3 hours  
**Previous Agent**: TASK-012-014 Agent

## Task Description
Design and implement the core layout components for the StreamVibe TV App including the responsive grid system, navigation menu, content cards, video details page, and modal/overlay components. These UI components will form the visual foundation of the application and ensure a consistent, appealing, and TV-optimized user experience.

## Context
This is part of the StreamVibe TV App being developed for the Senza platform hackathon. The application aims to create an AI-powered interactive TV experience optimized for remote control navigation at 1920x1080 resolution.

## Current Status
The core application infrastructure, navigation system, and state management components have been implemented. Now we need to build the primary UI layout components that will structure the application visually.

## Requirements

### TASK-015: Create responsive grid layout system (1920x1080)
- Design a grid system optimized for 1920x1080 resolution
- Implement responsive container components
- Create row and column components with appropriate spacing
- Build section layout components for content organization
- Implement TV-safe zone awareness
- Create aspect ratio preservation utilities

### TASK-016: Build main navigation menu component
- Design primary navigation menu structure
- Implement horizontal/vertical navigation patterns
- Create animated menu transitions
- Build menu item components with focus states
- Implement sub-menu support
- Create header component with navigation integration

### TASK-017: Implement content card components
- Design content card UI with multiple variations
- Create poster/thumbnail image components
- Implement content metadata display
- Build focus/hover states with animations
- Create card loading state skeletons
- Implement card action menu

### TASK-018: Create video details page layout
- Design comprehensive video details page
- Implement hero banner component
- Create metadata section with formatting
- Build related content section
- Implement action buttons (play, save, etc.)
- Create expandable description component

### TASK-019: Build modal and overlay components
- Design modal container with TV-friendly dimensions
- Implement focus-trapping within modals
- Create various overlay types (info, confirmation, error)
- Build transition animations for modals/overlays
- Implement backdrop component
- Create standardized modal action buttons

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, CSS Modules, React Spring (animations)
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/components/layout/Grid.js - Grid system components
  - src/components/navigation/MainMenu.js - Navigation menu
  - src/components/content/ContentCard.js - Content card components
  - src/components/pages/VideoDetails.js - Video details page
  - src/components/ui/Modal.js - Modal and overlay components
- **Components/Services**: 
  - Grid, Row, Column - Layout foundation components
  - MainMenu, MenuItem - Navigation components
  - ContentCard - Content display component
  - VideoDetailsPage - Details page layout
  - Modal, Overlay - Modal and overlay components

## Success Criteria
- Layout components are visually appealing and consistent
- Grid system correctly handles 1920x1080 resolution
- Navigation menu integrates with the focus management system
- Content cards display information clearly and support focus states
- Video details page presents comprehensive information
- Modals and overlays work correctly with focus management
- All components are responsive within the TV context
- Animations enhance the user experience without causing performance issues

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use CSS Modules for component-specific styling
- Create a consistent design language across all components
- Ensure all components work with the navigation system
- Optimize for TV viewing distance (larger text, clear focus states)
- Use CSS variables for theming and consistency
- Implement performance optimizations like React.memo
- Follow accessibility best practices where applicable
- Create responsive behaviors that work within TV constraints

## Testing Approach
- Verify layout at 1920x1080 resolution
- Test navigation between all components
- Verify focus states are clearly visible
- Test modal focus trapping
- Check component responsiveness
- Verify animation performance
- Test with mock content data

## Notes from Current Agent
I've implemented all the layout and UI components for the StreamVibe TV App as required in TASK-015 to TASK-019. Here's a summary of what's been accomplished:

### TASK-015: Responsive Grid Layout System
- Created a flexible grid system optimized for 1920x1080 resolution
- Implemented Container, Row, Col, Section, and AspectRatio components
- Added TV-safe zone awareness with appropriate padding
- Ensured consistent spacing and alignment across components

### TASK-016: Main Navigation Menu
- Designed a modern, horizontal navigation menu with focus states
- Implemented sub-menu support with smooth animations
- Created user profile and search areas in the header
- Built fully keyboard-navigable menu components
- Integrated with the existing navigation system

### TASK-017: Content Card Components
- Created a versatile content card component with multiple variants (poster, landscape, featured, small)
- Implemented dynamic content overlays with metadata display
- Built focus/hover states with animations
- Added loading state skeletons for better UX
- Integrated watch progress indicators
- Supported badges, ratings, and other content metadata

### TASK-018: Video Details Page
- Designed a comprehensive video details page with hero banner
- Implemented metadata sections with proper formatting
- Created expandable description components
- Built related content grid with proper navigation
- Added action buttons for playback and user collections

### TASK-019: Modal and Overlay Components
- Created a flexible modal system with focus-trapping
- Implemented various overlay types (info, confirmation, error, loading)
- Added smooth transition animations
- Built standardized action buttons
- Ensured keyboard navigation works within modals

All components are fully integrated with the existing navigation system and focus management, ensuring a smooth TV navigation experience using remote controls. The components use consistent styling and animations to provide a cohesive user interface.

The design system follows TV UI best practices with:
- Large, clear focus states
- Appropriate text sizes for viewing distance
- Smooth, subtle animations that enhance rather than distract
- Logical navigation flows
- Consistent layout and spacing

These UI components provide the visual foundation for the application and can now be used to build the complete user interface in subsequent tasks.
