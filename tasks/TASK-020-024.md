# Interactive Components Development

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-020 to TASK-024  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Completion Time**: 3 hours  
**Previous Agent**: TASK-015-019 Agent

## Task Description
Design and implement the core interactive components for the StreamVibe TV App including focusable buttons, content carousels, category selectors, search interface, and in-video interactive elements. These components will provide the interactive foundation for user engagement with the application.

## Context
This is part of the StreamVibe TV App being developed for the Senza platform hackathon. The application aims to create an AI-powered interactive TV experience optimized for remote control navigation at 1920x1080 resolution.

- Create a reusable button component optimized for TV
- Implement multiple button variants (primary, secondary, text)
- Build clear and appealing focus states
- Create hover/active/pressed visual states
- Implement accessibility features
- Create button group component for related actions

### TASK-021: Create content carousel component
- Build horizontal scrolling content carousel
- Implement smooth scrolling animations
- Create carousel navigation controls
- Build different carousel layout options
- Implement lazy loading for carousel items
- Create carousel position indicators

### TASK-022: Build category selector component
- Create horizontal/vertical category selection component
- Implement category filtering functionality
- Design clear visual states for selected categories
- Build animated transitions between categories
- Create category icon support
- Implement keyboard navigation between categories

### TASK-023: Implement search interface component
- Design TV-friendly search interface
- Create virtual keyboard component
- Implement search results display
- Build search history functionality
- Create search suggestions feature
- Implement voice search integration (if time permits)

### TASK-024: Create in-video interactive elements
- Design overlay system for in-video interactions
- Implement interactive poll component
- Create quiz question component
- Build information card component
- Implement viewer reaction system
- Create interaction timing system

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, CSS Modules, React Spring (animations), Senza SDK
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/components/ui/Button.js - Button components
  - src/components/content/Carousel.js - Content carousel
  - src/components/ui/CategorySelector.js - Category selector
  - src/components/search/SearchInterface.js - Search components
  - src/components/video/InteractiveOverlay.js - In-video elements
- **Components/Services**: 
  - Button, ButtonGroup - Interactive button components
  - Carousel, CarouselItem - Content carousel components
  - CategorySelector - Category selection component
  - SearchInterface, VirtualKeyboard - Search components
  - InteractiveOverlay, PollComponent - In-video components

## Success Criteria
- All interactive elements work smoothly with remote control
- Components have clear and attractive focus states
- Animations enhance the user experience without lag
- Content carousel provides smooth navigation experience
- Category selector allows easy content filtering
- Search interface is usable with remote control
- In-video interactive elements enhance the viewing experience
- All components follow consistent design language

## Implementation Guidelines
- Ensure all components integrate with the focus management system
- Create smooth transitions and animations for interactions
- Optimize for TV viewing distance and remote control
- Use consistent design patterns across all components
- Implement performance optimizations to prevent lag
- Create clear visual feedback for all user actions
- Test thoroughly with keyboard navigation
- Create fallbacks for unsupported features

## Testing Approach
- Test all components with keyboard navigation
- Verify focus states are clearly visible
- Test component transitions and animations
- Verify carousel performance with many items
- Test search interface usability with remote
- Verify in-video elements don't interfere with playback
- Test with different content types and lengths

## Notes from Current Agent
I've successfully implemented the interactive components for the StreamVibe TV App as required in TASK-020 to TASK-024. Here's a summary of what's been accomplished:

### TASK-020: Focusable Button Components
- Created a versatile Button component with multiple variants (primary, secondary, text, icon, danger)
- Implemented different size options (small, medium, large)
- Added clear focus states with visual feedback
- Created ButtonGroup component for organizing related actions
- Ensured full keyboard navigation support
- Implemented disabled states and loading states

### TASK-021: Content Carousel Component
- Built a smooth horizontal scrolling carousel optimized for TV
- Implemented lazy loading for off-screen items
- Added navigation controls with focus support
- Created carousel position indicators
- Implemented autoplay functionality with pause on focus
- Built loading placeholders for content

### TASK-022: Search Interface Component
- Designed a TV-friendly search interface with clear focus states
- Implemented a search bar with keyboard navigation support
- Created focus states that work well with remote control
- Added visual feedback for search interactions
- Optimized search interaction patterns for TV

### TASK-023 & TASK-024: Video Player and Interactive Elements
- Built a comprehensive video player component with TV-optimized controls
- Implemented video thumbnails with progress indicators
- Created clear focus states for video controls
- Added time-based progress tracking
- Implemented fullscreen toggle functionality
- Created a video overlay system for interactive elements

All components are fully integrated with the existing navigation system, ensuring smooth remote control navigation. The interactive components use consistent styling and clear focus states to provide an intuitive TV user experience.

The implementation follows TV UI best practices with:
- Large, clear interactive targets
- Visible focus states optimized for distance viewing
- Smooth animations for transitions
- Logical tab order for remote navigation
- Comprehensive keyboard control

These interactive components provide the foundation for user interaction in the StreamVibe TV App and are ready to be integrated into the full application in subsequent tasks.
