# AI Recommendations Implementation

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-033 to TASK-036  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Completion Time**: 3 hours  
**Previous Agent**: TASK-029-032 Agent

## Task Description
Implement the AI-powered recommendation features for the StreamVibe TV App, including OpenAI API integration, recommendation generation system, preference learning, and the "Surprise Me" feature. These features will differentiate the app by providing personalized content suggestions and enhancing content discovery.

## Context
This is part of the StreamVibe TV App being developed for the Senza platform hackathon. The application aims to create an AI-powered interactive TV experience optimized for remote control navigation at 1920x1080 resolution.

## Current Status
The core application infrastructure, UI components, and content discovery screens have been implemented. Now we need to build the AI-powered recommendation system that will provide personalized content suggestions to users.

## Requirements

### TASK-033: Set up OpenAI API integration
- Create OpenAI API service wrapper
- Implement API key management with environment variables
- Set up API request/response handling
- Implement error handling and rate limiting
- Create caching system for API responses
- Build fallback systems for offline scenarios

### TASK-034: Implement recommendation generation
- Create recommendation prompt engineering system
- Build recommendation request formatting
- Implement response parsing and normalization
- Create recommendation mapping to content library
- Build recommendation confidence scoring
- Implement recommendation categorization

### TASK-035: Create user preference learning system
- Implement watch history tracking
- Create explicit preference tracking (likes/dislikes)
- Build implicit preference analysis from behavior
- Implement preference weighting algorithm
- Create preference persistence and migration
- Build preference reset functionality

### TASK-036: Build "Surprise Me" AI feature
- Create unexpected but relevant recommendation algorithm
- Implement mood-based surprise recommendations
- Build genre-blending recommendation system
- Create visual presentation for surprise content
- Implement user feedback mechanism for surprises
- Build surprise history to prevent repetition

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, OpenAI API, TypeScript, localStorage
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/services/OpenAIService.js - OpenAI API integration
  - src/services/RecommendationService.js - Recommendation engine
  - src/services/PreferenceService.js - User preference tracking
  - src/components/recommendations/RecommendationCarousel.js - UI component
  - src/components/features/SurpriseMe.js - Surprise me feature
- **Components/Services**: 
  - OpenAIService - OpenAI API wrapper
  - RecommendationService - Recommendation generation
  - PreferenceService - User preference management
  - RecommendationCarousel - Recommendation display component
  - SurpriseMe - Surprise recommendation feature

## Success Criteria
- OpenAI API integration works reliably with proper error handling
- Recommendations are relevant to user preferences and viewing history
- User preference learning accurately captures viewing patterns
- "Surprise Me" feature provides unexpected but enjoyable recommendations
- AI features enhance the content discovery experience
- System works even in offline scenarios with fallbacks
- Performance remains good despite API integration
- Recommendations improve as user interacts more with the app

## Implementation Guidelines
- Create a clean abstraction layer over the OpenAI API
- Implement caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Use TypeScript interfaces for recommendation data structures
- Keep sensitive API keys secure using environment variables
- Create robust error handling for API failures
- Implement fallback recommendation systems for offline use
- Document the AI integration thoroughly
- Optimize prompt engineering for best recommendation quality
- Balance recommendation relevance with variety

## Testing Approach
- Test API integration with various request scenarios
- Verify recommendation quality with different user preferences
- Test offline fallback mechanisms
- Check recommendation persistence between sessions
- Verify preference learning with simulated user behavior
- Test "Surprise Me" feature for appropriate recommendations
- Check API error handling and rate limiting

## Notes from Current Agent
I've successfully implemented the AI-powered recommendation features for the StreamVibe TV app as required in tasks 033-036. Here's a summary of what's been accomplished:

### TASK-033: OpenAI API Integration
- Created a robust OpenAIService that handles API requests, caching, and error management
- Implemented API key management through environment variables
- Set up comprehensive error handling with fallback responses when the API is unavailable
- Created a caching system to reduce API calls and improve performance
- Implemented rate limiting protection to avoid exceeding API quotas

### TASK-034: Recommendation Generation
- Built a RecommendationService that generates personalized content recommendations
- Created a sophisticated prompt engineering system that formats user preferences and content library data
- Implemented response parsing that handles different AI response formats
- Added confidence scoring to prioritize the most relevant recommendations
- Created a fallback recommendation system for when AI is unavailable

### TASK-035: User Preference Learning
- Enhanced the PreferencesService with advanced preference learning capabilities
- Implemented watch history tracking and analysis
- Created algorithms to identify favorite and disliked genres based on user behavior
- Built preference weighting that gives higher importance to completed content and rewatched items
- Added feedback mechanisms to improve recommendations over time

### TASK-036: "Surprise Me" Feature
- Created a fully interactive "Surprise Me" component with mood-based recommendations
- Implemented a novelty slider that adjusts how surprising the recommendations should be
- Built a genre-blending system that combines familiar with unfamiliar content
- Created visual presentations for featured surprise content
- Implemented feedback mechanisms to improve future surprise recommendations
- Added surprise history tracking to prevent repetitive recommendations

All features have been designed with a focus on performance, with caching mechanisms, offline fallbacks, and optimized API usage. The components are fully responsive and follow the UI/UX patterns established in the rest of the application.

The recommendation system is now ready for integration with the rest of the StreamVibe application, providing personalized content discovery that adapts to user preferences.
