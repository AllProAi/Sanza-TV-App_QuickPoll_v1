# State Management Components

## Task Overview
**Task ID**: TASK-012 to TASK-014  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Completion Time**: 2 hours  
**Previous Agent**: TASK-011 Agent

## Task Description
Implement the core state management components for the StreamVibe TV App including content data models, user preferences storage, and video playback state management. These components will build upon the global state context created in TASK-011 and provide the specific data structures and services needed for the application functionality.

## Context
This is part of the StreamVibe TV App being developed for the Senza platform hackathon. The application aims to create an AI-powered interactive TV experience optimized for remote control navigation at 1920x1080 resolution.

## Current Status
The global React Context structure has been set up in TASK-011. Now we need to implement the specific data models, persistence mechanisms, and state management logic that will power the application features.

## Requirements

### TASK-012: Create content data models and services
- Define TypeScript interfaces for content data models
- Implement data transformation utilities
- Create mock data services for development
- Build API service layer for content retrieval
- Implement caching strategy for content data
- Create content search and filtering utilities

### TASK-013: Implement user preferences storage
- Define user preferences data model
- Implement local storage persistence
- Create utilities for preference management
- Build preference migration strategy for updates
- Implement default preferences for new users
- Create preferences reset functionality

### TASK-014: Build video playback state management
- Create video playback state model
- Implement integration with Senza remotePlayer
- Build watch history tracking
- Create utilities for playback position management
- Implement playback controls state
- Create event system for playback state changes

## Technical Details
- **Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, localStorage API, Senza SDK
- **Related Files**: 
  - src/models/Content.ts - Content data models
  - src/services/ContentService.ts - Content API service
  - src/services/PreferencesService.ts - User preferences service
  - src/services/PlaybackService.ts - Video playback service
  - src/hooks/useContent.ts - Hook for content data
  - src/hooks/usePreferences.ts - Hook for user preferences
  - src/hooks/usePlayback.ts - Hook for video playback
- **Components/Services**: 
  - ContentService - Content data retrieval and management
  - PreferencesService - User preferences management
  - PlaybackService - Video playback state management

## Success Criteria
- Content models properly represent all required data
- User preferences persist correctly between sessions
- Video playback state works seamlessly with Senza remotePlayer
- Services integrate properly with React Context
- Data is cached appropriately for performance
- Mock data is available for development
- TypeScript interfaces provide proper type safety

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all data models and services
- Create clear separation between data models and services
- Implement service factory pattern for easier testing
- Use React hooks to connect services to components
- Implement proper error handling for all async operations
- Cache content data for performance
- Use localStorage with fallbacks for preference storage
- Document all models and services

## Testing Approach
- Test data model validation
- Verify service integration with React Context
- Test localStorage persistence
- Verify playback state management with Senza SDK
- Test content filtering and search utilities
- Verify cache behavior

## Notes from Current Agent
I've implemented the core state management components for the StreamVibe TV App as required. Here's a summary of what's been accomplished:

### TASK-012: Content Data Models and Services
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all content-related data
- Implemented a ContentService with mock data generation for development
- Added caching mechanisms to improve performance
- Built robust content filtering, searching, and sorting capabilities
- Implemented watch progress tracking functionality

### TASK-013: User Preferences Storage
- Defined detailed user and preference data models
- Implemented localStorage persistence for user preferences
- Created utilities for profile management and preference updates
- Added support for favorites, watchlist, and recently watched features
- Implemented preferences migration strategy for app updates

### TASK-014: Video Playback State Management
- Created comprehensive playback state model
- Implemented integration with Senza remotePlayer
- Built watch history and playback position tracking
- Added event handling system for playback state changes
- Implemented localStorage persistence for playback history

All components have been designed with performance in mind, using techniques like:
- Memoization to prevent unnecessary renders
- Selective state updates
- Cached data management
- Local storage persistence with error handling

The services are connected with the existing context providers through custom hooks that make it easy to access functionality throughout the application while maintaining good separation of concerns.

These components provide a solid foundation for the application's state management needs and integrate well with the existing infrastructure created in TASK-011.
