I see you're working on the StreamVibe TV App for the Senza platform. Let me explore the current project structure to understand where we are with these tasks.

Let me examine the project structure in more detail to understand the current state:

Let me look at the package.json to understand the current dependencies:

---

Read file: StreamVibe/package.json

Let me look at the project structure in the src directory:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory StreamVibe/src • **13** results</summary>

Let's check if the Senza SDK service has been implemented:

Let's check the navigation setup:

Let me check App.tsx to understand the current application structure:

Read file: StreamVibe/src/App.tsx

---

Let me check what components have been implemented:

---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory StreamVibe/src/components • **3** results</summary>
        
| Name |

| 📁 `layout` |
| 📁 `navigation` |

</details>

---

Let's check the Vite configuration:

---

Read file: StreamVibe/vite.config.ts

---

Based on my analysis of the project structure and files, I can see that TASK-001 has been completed and there's already progress on some parts of TASK-002 to TASK-005:

1. The project is using Vite instead of Webpack for bundling
2. React Router is set up with initial routes
3. Senza SDK is installed and basic initialization is implemented
4. There's a project structure in place for components, pages, and services

Here's what we need to complete for TASK-002 to TASK-005:

1. Expand the Vite configuration (replacing Webpack requirement)
2. Create a comprehensive Senza SDK service with utility wrappers
3. Implement full app lifecycle management
4. Enhance the routing and navigation foundation

Let me know which specific task you'd like to focus on first, and I'll help you implement it.
