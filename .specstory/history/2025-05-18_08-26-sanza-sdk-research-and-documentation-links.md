      messages: [
        {
          role: "system", 
          content: "You are a TV content recommendation system. Provide 5 recommendations based on user preferences in JSON format."
        },
        {
          role: "user",
          content: `User preferences: ${JSON.stringify(userPreferences)}`
        }
      ]
    })
  });

+ 
+ ### 1.3 Data Flow
+ ```
+ User Input → React Component → State Update → 
+     ↓
+ Senza SDK Actions ← → External API Calls
+     ↓
+ UI Rendering → User Feedback
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 2. Component Architecture
+ 
+ ### 2.1 Core Components
+ - `App`: Main container and routing
+ - `NavigationGrid`: Remote-friendly content grid
+ - `FocusableItem`: Base component for remote navigation
+ - `VideoPlayer`: Wrapper around Senza remotePlayer
+ - `AIRecommendations`: Content suggestion component
+ - `InteractiveOverlay`: In-video interactive elements
+ 
+ ### 2.2 State Management
+ - `AppContext`: Global application state

+ - `ContentContext`: Content and recommendations state
+ - `PlayerContext`: Video playback state
+ 
+ ### 2.3 Component Hierarchy
+ ```
+ App
+ ├── Header
+ ├── NavigationMenu
+ ├── ContentBrowser
+ │   ├── CategoryRow
+ │   │   └── ContentCard
+ │   └── FeaturedContent
+ ├── VideoPlayer
+ │   ├── PlayerControls
+ │   └── InteractiveOverlay
+ └── Footer
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 3. Technical Implementation
+ 
+ ### 3.1 Remote Control Navigation
+ Implement a focus management system that:
+ - Tracks the currently focused element
+ - Handles directional navigation (up, down, left, right)
+ - Provides visual feedback for focused elements
+ - Supports nested navigation contexts
+ 
+ ```javascript
+ // Navigation Context Example
+ const NavigationContext = createContext({
+   focusedElement: null,
+   setFocus: () => {},
+   navigateLeft: () => {},
+   navigateRight: () => {},
+   navigateUp: () => {},
+   navigateDown: () => {},
+   select: () => {}
+ });
+ 
+ // Usage in component
+ const { focusedElement, setFocus } = useContext(NavigationContext);
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3.2 Video Playback Implementation
+ - Use Senza `remotePlayer` API for video loading and control
+ - Implement lifecycle transitions between browsing and playback
+ - Create event listeners for playback state changes
+ - Build interactive overlay system for in-video interactions
+ 
+ ```javascript
+ // Example Video Player Implementation
+ import { remotePlayer, lifecycle } from 'senza-sdk';
+ 
+ const playVideo = async (videoUrl) => {
+   try {
+     await remotePlayer.load(videoUrl);
+     await remotePlayer.play(true);
+     lifecycle.moveToBackground();
+   } catch (error) {
+     console.error('Video playback error:', error);
+   }
+ };
+ 
+ // Handle video end
+ remotePlayer.addEventListener('ended', () => {
+   lifecycle.moveToForeground();
+   // Show recommendations
+ });
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 3.3 AI Integration
+ - Create API wrapper for OpenAI integration
+ - Implement caching for recommendations
+ - Build preference learning algorithm based on user interactions
+ - Develop fallback recommendations for offline scenarios
+ 
+ ## 4. Data Models
+ 
+ ### 4.1 Content Model
+ ```typescript
+ interface Content {
+   id: string;
+   title: string;
+   description: string;
+   thumbnailUrl: string;
+   videoUrl: string;
+   duration: number;
+   categories: string[];
+   tags: string[];
+   releaseDate: string;
+   interactiveElements?: InteractiveElement[];
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ### 4.2 User Preferences Model
+ ```typescript
+ interface UserPreferences {
+   favoriteCategories: string[];
+   watchHistory: {
+     contentId: string;
+     watchedAt: string;
+     completionPercentage: number;
+   }[];
+   explicitPreferences: {
+     liked: string[];
+     disliked: string[];
+   };
+ }
+ ```
+ 
+ ## 5. Performance Considerations
+ 
+ ### 5.1 Rendering Optimization
+ - Implement virtualized lists for large content collections
+ - Use React.memo for component memoization
+ - Implement lazy loading for images and content
+ 
+ ### 5.2 State Management Efficiency
