## Accessibility Guidelines

QuickPoll is committed to creating an accessible experience for all users. All contributions should adhere to these accessibility principles:

### Remote Control Navigation
- All interactive elements must be navigable using a standard TV remote (directional pad and select)
- Focus states must be clearly visible with high contrast
- Navigation paths should be logical and predictable
- No functionality should require a keyboard, mouse, or touch input

### Visual Design
- Maintain a minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for all text
- Do not rely on color alone to convey information
- Text should be a minimum of 24px on TV interfaces
- Provide sufficient spacing between interactive elements (minimum 16px)

### Timing and Interaction
- Allow sufficient time for users to read and respond to polls
- Provide clear feedback when actions are taken
- Ensure animation and transitions can be disabled
- Design for different user response times

### Testing
- Test with screen readers and assistive technology
- Verify remote-only navigation works fully
- Confirm all UI is visible at standard TV resolutions
- Check for colorblind-friendly design

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create an issue first** to discuss proposed changes
2. **Update documentation** to reflect any changes
3. **Include tests** for new functionality
4. **Ensure all tests pass** locally before submitting
5. **Submit your pull request** with a clear description:
   - What the PR accomplishes

   - Testing you've performed
   - Screenshots for UI changes

### Review Process

1. At least one core team member will review your PR
2. Automated tests must pass
