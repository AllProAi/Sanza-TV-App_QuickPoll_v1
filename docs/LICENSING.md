# QuickPoll Licensing

This document outlines the licensing terms for the Sanza TV App QuickPoll platform. Our licensing approach balances open-source community contribution with protection of commercial interests.

## Dual Licensing Model

The QuickPoll application is available under a dual licensing model:

1. **Open Source License (AGPL v3)** - For community use, educational purposes, and open-source projects
2. **Commercial License** - For commercial deployments and proprietary integrations

## Open Source License

The core QuickPoll platform is released under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL-3.0)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html). This license:

- Ensures the source code remains open and available
- Requires that any modified versions must also be distributed under the AGPL
- Mandates that anyone who uses the software over a network must be able to download the source code
- Protects against proprietary forks without contribution back to the community

### What You Can Do Under AGPL
- Use the software for personal, educational, or non-commercial purposes
- Modify the software for your own use
- Distribute the software and source code to others
- Create and share improvements with the community

### What You Must Do Under AGPL
- Include copyright notices and the original license
- Make source code available when you distribute the software
- Share modifications under the same license
- Provide source code to users who interact with the software over a network

## Commercial License

For commercial and proprietary use cases, a separate commercial license is available from Daniel Hill / AllPro.Enterprises. This license:

- Allows integration with proprietary systems without AGPL requirements
- Enables OEM and white-label distribution
- Provides additional support and warranty options
- Removes the obligation to disclose source code to end users

### Commercial Use Cases Requiring Licensing
- Integration with proprietary content management systems
- Embedding QuickPoll in commercial TV platforms or applications
- Creating proprietary extensions or modifications
- White-labeling or rebranding the platform for resale
- Using the analytics engine for commercial data services

## The Open Core Approach

QuickPoll follows an "open core" model:

1. **Core Platform (Open Source)**
   - Basic polling functionality
   - Standard user interface components
   - Core interactive services
   - Basic analytics
   
2. **Premium Features (Commercial License)**
   - Advanced audience targeting
   - AI-powered content analysis
   - Enterprise-grade analytics dashboard
   - Custom branding capabilities
   - SLA-backed support

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

All contributors to the project must sign our Contributor License Agreement. This agreement:

- Allows the project to maintain its dual licensing model
- Ensures contributions can be included in both open source and commercial versions
- Preserves the rights of Daniel Hill / AllPro.Enterprises to monetize commercial versions
- Gives contributors proper attribution for their work

## Trademark Usage

## Licensing FAQ

### Q: Can I use QuickPoll in my commercial product?
**A:** Yes, but you need to purchase a commercial license unless you're willing to make your entire application AGPL-licensed and provide source code to users.

### Q: Do I need a commercial license to use QuickPoll for internal purposes within my company?
**A:** If you're only using it internally and not offering it as a service to others, the AGPL may be sufficient. However, any modifications must be kept available to your users.

### Q: Can I contribute to QuickPoll while working for a company?
**A:** Yes, but you'll need to sign the Contributor License Agreement, and your company may need to approve this contribution.

### Q: How do I purchase a commercial license?
**A:** Contact our licensing team at licensing@allpro.enterprises or visit [our website](https://allpro.enterprises/licensing).

### Q: Can I create and distribute my own plugins/extensions for QuickPoll?
**A:** Yes. If they integrate tightly with QuickPoll and include its code, they must be AGPL-licensed unless you have a commercial license. If they communicate with QuickPoll only through its documented APIs, you may license them as you choose.
