# TYPE-FIX-006: Method Return Types and Type Handling

## Description
This fix addresses TypeScript errors related to method return types and handling of potentially null values, primarily in various service methods.

## Files Fixed

### ContentService.ts
- Fixed return type issues by properly handling null returns from `getFromCache` by checking if the cached data exists before returning it
- Added null checks to methods: `getAllContent`, `getCategories`, `getCategoryContent`, `searchContent`, `filterContent`, and `getRecentlyWatched`
- Updated cache handling pattern to consistently return proper typed values

### PersonalizedGreeting.ts
- Added missing `UserPreferenceData` interface with proper type definitions for:
  - Added missing `title` property to `watchHistory` items
  - Added missing `viewingFrequency` property
- Fixed the `greetingRotation` property to use `Record<string, number>` instead of `string[]` array
- Updated the `generateAIGreeting` method to safely handle potentially undefined properties

### RecommendationService.ts
- Fixed the `parseAIResponse` method to handle recommendations with string or number scores
- Added proper type conversion logic with `typeof` check
- Replaced usage of `ContentRecommendationRaw` with `ContentRecommendation` type

## Impact
These fixes improve type safety and prevent potential runtime errors when working with cached data or API responses. By properly handling null and undefined values, we've eliminated a class of potential exceptions that could occur when expected values are not available.

## Verified
All services now correctly handle their data types with proper null checking, making the application more stable and maintainable.
